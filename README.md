# model_vector_comparison

This script generates query embeddings in PyTorch to simulate how Elasticsearch creates them during semantic search, and provides a cosine similarity function to compare the similarity between the two vectors. This is to identify and troubleshoot any possible differences with how Elasticsearch is generating vectors.
